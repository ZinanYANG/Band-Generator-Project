# Band-Generator-Project
# Web Application Project - Band Name Generator
Summary: I developed a web application using Node.js, Express, and EJS to create a Band Name Generator. The application generates unique band names by combining random adjectives and nouns from predefined arrays. It also includes dynamic content, such as a footer displaying the current year using JavaScript. The project showcases my skills in server setup, templating with EJS, handling GET and POST requests, and serving static files. Additionally, it demonstrates my ability to create a user-friendly web application with dynamic content. This project highlights my proficiency in full-stack web development, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
